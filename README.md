# Team_Ethan_Racing_Website
This is the website for Team Ethan Racing, originally developed by Sanchitsagar Singh (https://github.com/Singh-Sanchit/Ethan-Racing-Website). We have updated this upto ER7.0(FSEV 2021) and solved the glitches. Use this code to make changes about Further Achievements of the Team. #RiseTogether


_Note!_(For non-IT/CS person like me :P lol(ignore if you already know abt this, i had a hard time updating data and solving glitches :) and doing this is fun as  well lol))
This code has 5 different style.css files, so while updating data, it might occur that some colors are missing, or linking is not correct, so please check for those 5 style.css files to solve the issue.
Also while copying the previous code make sure that you put proper ID in both the id as well as in href.
